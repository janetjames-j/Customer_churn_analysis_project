# Customer Churn Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn behavior** to identify key factors that contribute to customer attrition.  
The goal is to help businesses improve **customer retention**, reduce churn rate, and make **data-driven decisions**.

The analysis is performed using Python with exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze customer churn patterns
- Identify key drivers of customer attrition
- Compare churn across customer segments
- Provide actionable business insights for retention strategies

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level information including:
- Customer demographics
- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly and total charges
- Payment method
- Churn status (Yes / No)

Each row represents a unique customer.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

##  Analysis Performed
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn distribution analysis
- Tenure vs churn analysis
- Contract type vs churn
- Monthly charges comparison
- Customer segmentation based on churn behavior

---

##  Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** show higher churn
- **Low-tenure customers** are more likely to churn
- Higher **monthly charges** increase churn risk
- Long-term contracts improve customer retention

---

##  Business Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts through discounts
- Focus retention strategies on early-tenure customers
- Offer personalized plans for high-risk churn customers
- Improve onboarding experience to reduce early churn
